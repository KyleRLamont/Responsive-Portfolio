      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Kyle LaMont. I am a 35 year old living in Seattle, WA. My pronouns are he/him. I have a 2 year old dog named Rory.</p>

      <p>I graduated in 2007 from the University of Pittsburgh with a BS in Psychology. I then worked for a variety of companies in their customer service departments.</p>

      <p>I am a web developer with strong skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy problem solving, as well as creating things.</p>
        
      <p>In my previous career, I worked with customers to resolve their issues in an insurance setting by reading policies and applying them to claims and issues. As a developer, I use this same sound logic and meticulousness to rapidly resolve issues and build pages.</p>
      
      <p>I am looking for a new opportunity in development that will utilize these skills, as well as allow me to grow in the visual aspects of development.</p>
